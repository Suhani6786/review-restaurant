🧩 UML Class Diagram

The project was designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and modeled with a **UML Class Diagram**. The UML diagram captures the key classes and relationships:

- **Reviewer**: Represents the logged-in user who can write/edit reviews  
- **Review**: Represents each review written by a user (with restaurant name, rating, comment, etc.)  
- **RestaurantReviewSystem**: Main GUI controller that handles interface logic and data coordination
